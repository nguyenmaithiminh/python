#Task
#Given  sets of integers,  and , print their symmetric difference in ascending order. The term symmetric difference indicates those values that exist in either  or  but do not exist in both.

#Input Format

#The first line of input contains an integer, .
#The second line contains  space-separated integers.
#The third line contains an integer, .
#The fourth line contains  space-separated integers.

n = int(input())
a = set(map(int, input().split()))
m = int(input())
b = set(map(int, input().split()))
result = a.union(b)-a.intersection(b)

print(*sorted(result), sep='\n')
